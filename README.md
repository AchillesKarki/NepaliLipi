# NepaliLipi
This is a text prediction application for Nepali language along with Nepali transliteration.

It uses Ngram algorithm, Markov's Chain Rule Principle and Backoff Algorithm to suggest/correct given word and also helps to predict the next suitable word using previous phrases and words. The application also learns the user input as the user types and uses those for future recommendations.

Transliteration is the process of expressing the sound of how a word is pronounced in the source language in the alphabet of the target language. Nepali transliteration converts the English language representation into Devnagari scripts.

The working demo of the application is given here https://achilles.shinyapps.io/nepalilipi/
